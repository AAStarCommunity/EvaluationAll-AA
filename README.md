## Evaluation

We use pnpm to cache all npm packages, and use pnpm to install all dependencies.
we will try the solutions provided by the above industry companies. Do these
jobs:

1. list productions/sdks and their serveice from website
2. get github repo from docs url
3. install dependencies and run demo in the start
4. finish basic operations with SDK: create account, initate gas payment, config
   paymaster, send tx, etc
5. give a simple analysis for project purpose, solution, cost, usability&UX in
   HCI, Decentralization in gas payment, Account, Relay; analysis traits in
   simple, time/efficiency, customize ERC20, direct cost; talk about HCI, TAM,
   SLT, support.
6. Evaluation on:
   1. Summary of main features, interfaces provided, and user scenarios
      demonstrating interface capabilities
   2. Developer complexity
   3. Acceptance of third-party ERC20 gas tokens
   4. Gas sponsor payment methods
